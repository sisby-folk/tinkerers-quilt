This modpack started in January 2021 as a skyrim-style "modding guide" - just throwing mods together and configuring them lightly.

But it quickly took shape when we realized people often struggle to get past the first half-hour of the game.

Turns out if you want your modpack to feel cohesive, good to play, and match a vision - you need to get your hands dirty.

We made six mods:
- [Portable Crafting Standalone](https://modrinth.com/mod/portable-crafting-standalone) - Press V or click a tab to use the crafting table in your inventory.
- [Totem Anywhere Standalone](https://modrinth.com/mod/totem-anywhere-standalone) - Totem of undying convenience - uses totems from inventory.
- [Crunchy Crunchy Advancements](https://modrinth.com/mod/crunchy-crunchy-advancements) - Hides and removes advancements - quests and [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) cover all you need.
- [Tinkerer's Statures](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-statures) - Allows choosing player height on spawn.<br/>     
  ![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174215100-2b630688-8ef5-4429-b82e-9516c132915a.png)

- [Origins Minus](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins-minus) - A full set of origins optimised for simplicity, not balance.<br/>     
  ![originsminus_transparent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/207250617-c4d83703-817c-47b7-8ddf-d2e915807df4.png)

- [Tinkerer's Smithing](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-smithing) - Repair for no XP cost, lower repair cost with scrap, and upgrade tool materials.<br/>     
  ![tinkerers-smithing-banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/184521392-5f0ddbd5-e9f5-4c7a-8262-ecb265e2e6cd.png)
    - Flattens mending power creep, encouraging players to keep "Sentimental" tools as much as they like.
    - Tool material upgrades cost the exact same as a fresh tool - but keep the enchantments.
    - Quicker tools with less waste - upgrade wood to stone to iron from the 2x2 crafting grid.

- [Switchy](https://modrinth.com/mod/switchy) - Change your origin, skin, and more between presets with a single command.<br/>     
  ![switchy banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/198210616-eb37be12-cd96-40c8-a941-68a96b2aadfc.png)

Two data packs: (use [this](https://download-directory.github.io) for downloads)
- [Tinkerer's Vegetarian](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_vegetarian) (NBT) - recipes for potions, leather, books, and more, without killing passive mobs.
- [Tinkerer's Copper Beacons](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_copper_beacons) - Allows beacons made of unexposed copper blocks. A use for copper and wax.

And of course, mod configuration:
- 194 Quests with just as much flavour text - queer humour, observations, and a weird mix of references.
    - 1074 lines of quest descriptions - tutorials, explanations, and so on.
    - Meticulously symmetrical and grouped quest positioning. No, really.
- Removing feature overlap
- Rebalancing mods
- Rebalancing vanilla via tweak mods (Shoutouts to Fabrication and Apathy)
- Ruining everyone's life by shipping a default `options.txt` file
- PR'ing improvements to mods (does it count as configuration if you apply it directly to the source code?)
- Reporting bugs to devs (does it count as configuration if you "configure" the mod to work better by asking nicely?)

## Headliner Mods
<details>
<summary>Click to Expand</summary>

All present minecraft modding is built on a decade of work from other people (and non-people, we don't discriminate).

Here's what others are bringing to this pack.

### Player Expression

Letting players express themselves with player customisation, builds, and even farming and cooking, is core to TQuilt.

- [Ears](https://ears.unascribed.com/) - Improved skins with support for tails, horns, ears, claws, wings and more species/gender things!
- [Fabric Tailor](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabrictailor) - Swap your skin in-game. Great for plural systems.
- [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins) - Choose a player _Origin_, granting abilities, limitations, and maybe some euphoria (we don't know you)

- [Drogtor](https://github.com/unascribed/Drogtor) - Change player name, color, and bio (e.g. pronouns) any time.
- [Presence Footsteps](https://modrinth.com/mod/presence-footsteps) - Footstep audio redone - allows swapping between bi/quadrupedal, with winged options.
- [Fabrication](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabrication) - A huge tweak mod, includes hiding armor and improvements for minecart networks.
- [Carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) - Many server tweaks, includes more uses for dispensers, and more regrowables.

## Usability and Accessibility

- [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) - An advanced recipe book that lets players find information on any item, and help craft it.
- [What The Hell Is That?](https://modrinth.com/mod/wthit) - Hold alt to see information on the block or mob you're looking at.     
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174112665-b8b534e2-5b8d-450e-91dd-260869086719.png)
- [Noteable](https://modrinth.com/mod/noteable) - Allows players to take in-game notes about their plans, locations to revisit, etc.
- [Reacharound](https://modrinth.com/mod/reacharound) - Build midair bridges without sneaking, and even downwards stairs.
- [Project: Save The Pets!](https://modrinth.com/mod/projectsavethepets) - Prevents pet harm and adds a pet revival system.
- [Horse Buff](https://modrinth.com/mod/horsebuff) - Improves and protects horses, making them easier to take out on adventures.
- [Fabrication](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabrication) - A multitude of minor improvements, such as automatic block pickup and crawling.
- [You're In Grave Danger](https://modrinth.com/mod/yigd) - Leaves a grave on death with your items and XP that won't de-spawn.
- [Apathy](https://modrinth.com/mod/apathy) - Mobs are neutral on easy difficulty, and will only attack you if provoked.

## Visuals

- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - Present-day holy grail of performance mods.
- [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - Optifine-compatible shaders. We recommend [Complementary](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders) or [Super Duper Vanilla](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/super-duper-vanilla-shaders/files/).
- Many more! Check the modlist.

## Alpha Versions

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand</summary>

Tinkerer's Quilt is designed to allow players to add their own mods.            
**Plus** and **Modded** is us giving that a shot - but it's **not ready for release yet**.

**The packwiz version is not save safe. Do not use the auto updater if you are keeping a save.**

- **Plus** is a Vanilla+ extension of base, expanding on **Godseeking**:
    - **Homesteading** - More farming/ranching, much more cooking, more building blocks, and more decorations.
    - **Exploration** - More traversal options, new nether/end, new biomes, new structures, and a seasonal world.
    - **Combat** - Spears, chef's knives, and... compact mechanically propelled halfdoors? Plus new dungeons.
- **Modded** uses TQuilt as a base for heavy content mods, like [Botania](https://modrinth.com/mod/botania), [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric), [Yttr](https://modrinth.com/mod/yttr), and [Hephaestus](https://modrinth.com/mod/hephaestus).
