## Vanilla Ice [Vanilla+ Content]

Tinkerer's Quilt Plus is a **Vanilla+ Modpack** - It adds a bit of content to items, blocks, and worlds, but doesn't add any elaborate new systems.

If you're looking for the original vanilla-compatible pack, that's [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt).

The content added is a slight expansion on exploration, self-defense, and homesteading. In total, it bumps the quest count to 193.

## Afterword

All present minecraft modding is built on a decade of work from other people (and non-people, we don't discriminate).

This modpack started in January 2021 as a skyrim-style vanilla+ "modding guide" - and only exists in the form it has today thanks to much help from the community!
