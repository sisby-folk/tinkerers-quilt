# Pack Features

## No Items, No Blocks, All Service [Vanilla-Compaibility]

Tinkerer's Quilt is **Vanilla Compatible** - It doesn't add any new blocks items, or world features.

It's still a **mixed-side** modpack - it needs to be **installed on both the client and any servers** you connect to.

If you want to play with Tinkerer's Quilt's tweaks on servers with vanilla players, try [Tinkerer's Silk](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-silk/gallery).

## A Playable Minecraft Wiki [Vanilla Quests]

Tinkerer's Quilt adds **166 quests** that help players explore minecraft.<br/>
From **basic game progression** to **niche mechanics** like mechanisms, building furniture, and **using beds as weapons**.

Tinkerer's Quilt focuses rebalancing on making the game accessible to more people, but also taking the sting out of **frustrating parts of vanilla**.

It's not just about making the game easier - with annoyances alleviated in death, movement, and equipment mechanics, more experienced players can **crank the difficulty** and have a blast!

## Pretty Pretty [Visuals]

Tinkerer's Quilt is just as opinionated about visuals as it is about everything else - it includes various visual tweaks and improvements for clarity, performance, and often just plain aesthetic!

In addition to the below, Tinkerer's Quilt has support for the majority of optifine-format resource packs, including things like connected textures and custom skyboxes, thanks to [optifine alternative mods](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/) made by the community.

# More Info

## Installation

### Stable (Modrinth)

Use your modrinth-supporting launcher of choice (e.g. [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/)) - follow [modrinth instructions](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/#multimc-and-prism-launcher), then **manually download the mods** listed in the [changelog](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt/changelog) for your version.

### Edge (Unsup)

This pack version auto-updates every launch. Slightly higher chance of experiencing pack-jank.

- Install [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) and [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) (on Windows? choose `Windows-x64-JRE-17-.msi`)
- Download Tinkerer's Quilt from the [downloads page](https://sisby-folk.github.io/tinkerers-quilt/).
- Drag and drop onto an open Prism window, press OK, and double click it to play!
- Whenever the pack updates, you'll be prompted on launch for if you'd like to update.
- When an update contains config changes, you'll often be prompted to allow the update overwrite your own. 
  - Clicking "yes to all" will allow the update to change these files universally.
  - If you're a more experienced user, you can manually reject configs you've set up how you like.
- Note that **deleting a file is no longer sufficient for it to be redownloaded**. To force the pack to "reverify" all pack files next launch (like steam), delete `unsup_state.json` from the instance folder.

#### Server

- Download the server from the [downloads page](https://sisby-folk.github.io/tinkerers-quilt/).
- Run the included Quilt Installer, selecting your minecraft version and the latest non-beta loader version.
- The provided `Start` script will both update and run the server via the JVM argument.

## Afterword

All present minecraft modding is built on a decade of work from other people (and non-people, we don't discriminate).

This modpack started in January 2021 as a skyrim-style vanilla+ "modding guide" - and only exists in the form it has today thanks to much help from the community!
