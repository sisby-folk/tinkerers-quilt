# Pack Features

## Vanilla Ice [Vanilla+ Content]

Tinkerer's Quilt Plus is a **Vanilla+ Modpack** - It adds a bit of content to items, blocks, and worlds, but doesn't add any elaborate new systems.

If you're looking for the original vanilla-compatible pack, that's [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt).

The content added is a slight expansion on exploration, self-defense, and homesteading. In total, it bumps the quest count to 193.

# More Info

## Installation

### Stable (Modrinth)

Use your modrinth-supporting launcher of choice (e.g. [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/)) - follow [modrinth instructions](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/#multimc-and-prism-launcher), then **manually download the mods** listed in the [changelog](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt/changelog) for your version.

### Edge (Unsup)

This pack version auto-updates every launch. Slightly higher chance of experiencing pack-jank.

- Install [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) and [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) (on Windows? choose `Windows-x64-JRE-17-.msi`)
- Download Tinkerer's Quilt from the [downloads page](https://sisby-folk.github.io/tinkerers-quilt/).
- Drag and drop onto an open Prism window, press OK, and double click it to play!
- Whenever the pack updates, you'll be prompted on launch for if you'd like to update.
- When an update contains config changes, you'll often be prompted to allow the update overwrite your own. 
  - Clicking "yes to all" will allow the update to change these files universally.
  - If you're a more experienced user, you can manually reject configs you've set up how you like.
- Note that **deleting a file is no longer sufficient for it to be redownloaded**. To force the pack to "reverify" all pack files next launch (like steam), delete `unsup_state.json` from the instance folder.

#### Server

- Download the server from the [downloads page](https://sisby-folk.github.io/tinkerers-quilt/).
- Run the included Quilt Installer, selecting your minecraft version and the latest non-beta loader version.
- The provided `Start` script will both update and run the server via the JVM argument.

### Notes

If you intend to play without shaders on a powerful machine, we highly recommend [QDAA](https://modrinth.com/mod/qdaa/version/1.1.2) to improve visual consistency.

If you experience arachnophobia or otherwise need to disable the spawning of a mob entirely, try [VanillaDisable](https://modrinth.com/mod/vanilla-disable).

If you'd like to play with a controller, install [MidnightControls](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightcontrols) before playing.

If you get lost without a map mod, try our [fork of Antique Atlas](https://github.com/sisby-folk/AntiqueAtlas/releases/tag/v8.0.2%2Bitemless) without items. Still required on both sides.

## Afterword

All present minecraft modding is built on a decade of work from other people (and non-people, we don't discriminate).

This modpack started in January 2021 as a skyrim-style vanilla+ "modding guide" - and only exists in the form it has today thanks to much help from the community!
